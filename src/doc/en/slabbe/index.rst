Sébastien Labbé Research Code Reference Manual
==============================================

This is the reference manual for the `Sébastien Labbé
<http://www.liafa.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~labbe>`_ Research Code extension to
the `Sage <http://sagemath.org/>`_ mathematical software system.  Sage is free
open source math software that supports research and teaching in algebra,
geometry, number theory, cryptography, and related areas.  

Sébastien Labbé Research Code implements digital geometry, combinatorics on
words and symbolic dynamical systems simulation code in Sage, via a set of new
Python classes. 

This reference manual contains many examples that illustrate the usage of
slabbe spkg. The examples are all tested with each release of slabbe spkg, and
should produce exactly the same output as in this manual, except for line
breaks.
